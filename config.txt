# CONFIG FILE
# comment lines start with '#'
# the config file consists of several section; each section starts with the section name and ends with 'END SECTION'
# the contents of the file are case-sensitive

# CONFIG
# specify optimizer parameters with:
# parameter : value(s)
# note that the spaces around the colon are required
config

# teams specifies target team sizes, comma-separated
teams : 2, 2
# threads specifies number of cpu threads to use for optimization
threads : 4
# tolerances specifies tolerance score on each round of optimization, i.e. on each round, rosters will have scores s in [minBound, minBound + tolerance]
# increasing round 1 tolerance may increase the number of final rosters, but will likely not affect the optimal score
# increasing round 2 tolerance is not advised, as this would return many suboptimal results
tolerances : 0, 0
END SECTION

# TIMESLOTS
# specify each block with an integer; use -1 for signup events
# separate values with ' : ' (the spacing is required)
# events in block -1 do not conflict

timeslots
-1 : 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 : 5 : 6
END SECTION

# SCHEDULE
# specify each event with:
# event : block
# event : block : number of people (if it isn't 2)
# where the block number corresponds to the block in the timeslots section; not that the spacing around the colon is required

schedule
A : 1
B : 2
C : 3
D : 4
E : 5
F : 6
G : -1
H : -1 : 3
END SECTION

# TEAM
# specify the events for each team member with:
# name : event, event, event
# note that the spacing around the colon and after commas is required

team
a : A
b : B
c : C
d : D
e : E
f : F
g : G, H
END SECTION

# BUILDING
# list building events here
# building event assignments are scored differently than non-building event assignments

building
G
END SECTION

# STACKING/UNSTACKING
# specify which team members should be on the same team and which team members should be on different teams
# 'a + b' means that a and b will be on the same team
#     this also means that both a and b will be going
#     'a + a' ensures that a is going
# 'a - b' means that a and b will not be on the same team
#     either a and b will be on opposite teams, one of the two is not going, or neither is going
# note that the spacing around the '+' and '-' are required

stack
a + a
a - b
c + d
